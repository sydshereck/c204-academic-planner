#CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project

Welcome to the major project for CISC/CMPE 204 (Fall 2021)!

Choosing your courses and ensuring you are set up to take all of the required courses and prerequisites for your degree can be very stressful. This project aims to assess what courses a student must take to complete the Biomedical Computing specialization degree at Queens University.

The model will demonstrate the path that shows a student enrolled in all the mandatory fourth year courses needed to graduate. If no such path exists from first year to fourth, then it means that the student does not have all the correct courses. If the model does exist that means all the prerequisites needed are met and the student is set up to graduate with a Biomedical Computing degree.

Structure
documents: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
run.py: General wrapper script that you can choose to use or not. Only requirement is that you implement the one function inside of there for the auto-checks.
test.py: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
